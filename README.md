## 🧱 Architecture

The app follows a **Controller-Service Pattern**:


Each service contains the business logic for its respective domain.

All **wallet-related operations** such as **funding**, **withdrawal**, and **internal transfers** are handled within a dedicated controller (`v1/payment`). This is because these operations are exclusively powered by **Paystack**  excluding (In-app-transfer). They  serve a distinct transactional purpose.

> 🧾 Therefore, instead of distributing the logic across multiple services, it is encapsulated inside the controller to maintain cohesion and simplify payment-related processes.
